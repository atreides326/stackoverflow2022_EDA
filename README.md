# stackoverflow2022_EDA

csv file is too large to upload to git. use: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey 2022 data. place in files folder.

This project is part of an online course I'm taking and is my own work. I hope it is useful for new and mid level analyst to see a range of EDA skills used.
